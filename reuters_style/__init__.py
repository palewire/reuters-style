    Style guide entry:

        In text, use the sequence month/day/year, e.g., “Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait on
        Aug. 2, 1990, led to...” or “the Aug. 2 invasion” or “the August 1990 invasion.”

        If a specific date is used, put the year inside commas. Spell out months
        in text, but abbreviate them followed by a full stop when they are used
        with a specific date – Jan.1.

        When spelling out duration, write, “The tournament runs from May 22 to 24,”
        not “…runs from May 22-24.” Write “arrived on Monday,” not “arrived Monday”
        and “on Tuesday,” rather than “yesterday,” “today,” “tomorrow.” Write
        “the 1939-45 war” but “from 1939 to 1945,” not “from 1939-45.” Write 9/11,
        not 9-11. In commodities stories, write “Brazil’s 2013/14 soybean crop”
        (conventional use), not “2013-14.”

        Abbreviate as follows, noting the dot after the abbreviation: Jan., Feb.,
        March, April, May, June, July, Aug., Sept., Oct., Nov., Dec.

        24-hour clock time for a specified time zone, e.g., “will meet at 10 a.m.
        (1600 GMT).”

        Use figures except for noon and midnight. Use a colon to separate
        hours and minutes, e.g., 3:15 p.m. Use the style “on Friday,” “on Saturday,”
        rather than the looser “today,” “yesterday,” “tomorrow.”

        Do not use phrases like “several months ago” or “recently,” which suggest we do not know when something
